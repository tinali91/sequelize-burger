# burger

This app uses Node.js, Express.js and Express Handlebars to create a page that interacts with a mySQL database.

## Eat da burger!

Users are able to add burgers to the database, which will render on page with a button next to it that prompts users to "Devour it!"

Once users click to button, the burger will remain on the page, but will be grouped with other burgers that have been devoured. Users will no longer be able to interact with the burgers once they have been devoured.
